# Real_world_data_analysis_Multiple_Myeloma

An analysis of a Multiple Myeloma dataset to show the market share (prevalence / incidence) of Multiple Myeloma treatments over the three last half years for the first four therapy line.

I generated the distribution of treatment regimens over the time periods 2021HY1, 2021HY2 and 2022HY1 and i thedentify main regimens in each of the four lines and their evolution

I created a simple ETL pipeline to transform the Multiple Myeloma dataset into the OMOP person table format
